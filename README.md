# Hi there, I'm Thomas 👋

*Business-driven Data Analyst · Former Product Management Lead*  
*Building modern, end-to-end analytics solutions*

I’ve always been drawn to understanding how people use products — what works, what doesn’t, and why.  
Over 15+ years in product management, data consistently helped me make clearer, more structured decisions.  
Last year, I decided to go deeper: learning how to build the analytical pipelines, models, and metrics behind those decisions.

My focus now is the intersection of business understanding and modern analytics engineering — creating workflows and insights that help teams make more confident, data-informed decisions.
